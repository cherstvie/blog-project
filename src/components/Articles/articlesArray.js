            'The Mont-Saint-Michel is one of Europe’s most unforgettable sights. Set in a mesmerising bay shared by Normandy and Brittany, the mount draws the eye from a great distance.',
        fullDescription:
            '<p>This staggeringly beautiful location has long captured the imagination. The story of how the mount came to be a great Christian pilgrimage site dates back to the early 8th century, when Aubert, bishop of the nearby hilltop town of Avranches, claimed that the Archangel Michael himself had pressured him into having a church built atop the island just out to sea.</p><p>From 966 onwards, the dukes of Normandy, followed by the French kings, supported the development of a major Benedictine abbey on Mont-Saint-Michel. Magnificent monastic buildings were added throughout the Middle Ages, one vertiginous wing in particular being nicknamed the Marvel. The Abbey of the Mont-Saint-Michel became a renowned centre of learning, attracting some of the greatest minds and manuscript illuminators in Europe. Vast numbers of pilgrims visited, despite endless cross-Channel conflict; in fact, the ramparts at the base of the island were built to keep the English forces out. Other fine buildings line the steep village street, now converted into museums, restaurants, hotels and shops for today’s tourists.</p>',

            "Étretat is a town on the north coast of France. It’s known for the striking rock formations carved out of its white cliffs, including the Porte d'Aval arch and L'Aiguille (the Needle), a pillar rising up from the sea. To the north, the cliffside Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Garde has dramatic views",
        fullDescription:
            '<p>The cliffs and rock formations steal the show in Etretat, thanks to their exceptional natural beauty and the fact that famous Impressionists painted them so memorably. Erosion has created extraordinary arches in the chalk either side of the town. There’s also an amazing needle-like structure, known in French as the Aiguille. A walk up the cliffs to the west of Etretat leads you to an 18-hole golf course with breath-taking views over the Aiguille, while a walk to the east will bring you to the Jardins d’Etretat, a beautiful Asian-inspired garden affording stunning views over Etretat and its bay across to the Aval arch famously immortalised by Claude Monet and Eugène Boudin. Head back down to the seafront as the sun goes down and you can also see Etretat’s cliffs magically light up.</p><p>However, there is more to Etretat than the cliff formations and pebble beach. The small town beyond is picturesque and full of pretty restaurants and shops, while the remarkable wooden covered market and 19th-century villa Le Clos Lupin are both worth a visit.</p>',

            'Sardinia is a large Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea. It has nearly 2,000km of coastline, sandy beaches and a mountainous interior crossed with hiking trails',
        fullDescription:
            "<p>Look around you, you can already sense it as you climb the Golgo di Baunei plateau, from which the Supramonte stretches out. The landscape depicts primordial nature, where the archaic soul of Sardinia lingers: there is the abyss of su Sterru, an extremely deep and mysterious funnel-shaped karstic well next to the circle of nuragic stones that surround the piscinas, the natural basins that collected water for ancient rituals. There are domus de Janas hidden among the greenery and nuraghi in the hills overlooking Golgo and the village. These places, which have escaped the hand of man, stir the soul and fascinate in an atmosphere of enchantment and wonder. But that's just a prelude to what awaits you as you walk into the codula di Sisine, the underground river bed that rises to the mouth of the beautiful beach. The route is easy, with a gentle gradient, and leads to the sea, taking in all the beauty encountered along the way: limestone cliffs jutting skywards, canyons, caves, ravines and ridges covered with juniper trees and Mediterranean maquis, ancient sheepfolds, wild animals and a few shepherds.</p>",

Whether it’s a long sandy beach, a dramatic mountain pass or a beautiful hilltop village, Corsica holidays are packed full of rewarding things to do and see. The French know the island as Corse, sometimes they refer to Corsica as L'Ille de Beauté, when translated means The Island of Beauty. </p><p>With almost 200 beaches and 1000km of coastline, Corsica is a beach lover’s dream. The island is blessed with an incredible diversity of beaches from intimate hidden coves to magnificent bays. The most renowned include the sweeping bays of Calvi and L’Ile Rousse in the north, and Palombaggia, Pinarello and San Ciprianu in the south.</p>",

        fullDescription:
            "<p>The castle's history started in the Middle Ages when a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Pena was built on the top of the hill above Sintra. According to tradition, construction occurred after an apparition of the Virgin Mary.</p><p>The Pena Palace has a profusion of styles much in accordance with the exotic taste of the Romanticism. The intentional mixture of eclectic styles includes the Neo-Gothic, Neo-Manueline, Neo-Islamic and Neo-Renaissance. Much of this has been evident since major renovations in the 1840s. References to other prominent Portuguese buildings, such as the Belém Tower, are also present.</p><p>As many elements as possible were preserved of the remains of the Hieronymite convent including the cloister, the dining room, the sacristy, and the Manueline-Renaissance chapel. All were embedded in a new section that featured a wide terrace and a clock tower. The Queen's Terrace is perhaps the best spot for obtaining an overall picture of the architecture of the palace. The terrace features a sundial cannon that used to fire every day at noon. The clock tower was completed in 1843.</p>",

The exotic colours of the flowers stand out from among the blue sea and the emerald green vegetation; this is an archipelago where two thirds are a protected area and where the largest Laurisilva forest in the world is located.</p><p>The springtime temperature, felt all year round, cries out for open air activities. You can go for a walk along the network of levadas (irrigation channels), visit the city of Funchal and discover the heritage associated with the Discoveries or roam freely around the island. Boat rides are an excellent way of admiring the coastline from a different perspective.</p><p>In such a naturally welcoming environment, balance and well-being are taken for granted. Madeira offers various tourist complexes and accesses to the sea with prime conditions for leisure boating and scuba diving. The island of Porto Santo, in particular, is the ideal place to escape from stress and undertake a thalassotherapy programme, or a beach holiday combined with a spot of golf.</p>',

São Miguel, the largest island, is seductive with its Sete Cidades and Fogo Lagoons. The power that emanates from the earth is felt in the geysers, hot thermal waters and volcanic lakes, as well as in the tasty 'Cozido das Furnas' slowly cooked inside the earth.</p><p>In the Central Group, the islands of Terceira, São Jorge, Pico, Faial and Graciosa are set harmoniously in the deep blue sea, where whales and dolphins can be spotted, to the delight of visitors. On Terceira, the World Heritage town of Angra do Heroísmo, as well as its festivals, is steeped in history. Faial is the cool blue of the hydrangeas, the marina painted colourfully by yachtsmen from all over the world and the extinct Capelinhos volcano, which resembles a lunar landscape. In front is Pico, a mountain that emerges from the sea, with vineyards planted in black lava fields, a unique culture that also has World Heritage status. On São Jorge, the highlights are the Fajãs and the cheese, a unique specialty with an unmistakable flavour. Graciosa, graceful in both name and appearance, is an island of green fields covered with vineyards that contrast with its peculiar windmills.</p>",

That’s life on the largest of the Balearic Islands, a place of idyllic landscapes where the mountains are just a step away from the beach, and the inspiration for generations of writers, musicians and painters.</p><p>A trip to the island could start in Palma, its lively capital, and continue in villages where you can forget about the outside world, like Valldemosa or Sóller. The climate is always mild, and everywhere you go, you’ll find the true Mediterranean lifestyle and cuisine. Because Mallorca really embodies the Mediterranean spirit.</p><p>Palma is one of the most delightful cities to explore on foot in all of Spain. As well as the Cathedral, Bellver castle, Es Baluard museum and the Pilar i Joan Miró Foundation, we recommend venturing into its courtyards, eating at restaurants with cuisines from all over the world, shopping in the exclusive boutiques of Passeig del Born, and soaking up the sun at a pavement café.</p><p>You’ll be tempted to stay there forever, but Palma is just the entrance to a fascinating island. Travellers will find enchanting villages like Valldemossa, where the composer Chopin and the writer George Sand stayed in the Charterhouse. Very close by is Sóller, where you can take an antique train. Other options include Deià and the stunning gardens of Son Marroig, Pollença and its lively port, or Alcúdia and its unspoilt coves.</p><p>In all of these places, you can try the “slow food” trend in Michelin starred restaurants, at the harbours, or in the cake shops where they sell the famous ensaimada pastry. You can take the opportunity to buy some local crafts, or just relax over a cocktail in any of Mallorca’s exclusive beach clubs.</p>',

            'The Sagrada Familia church is considered to be the best example of Modernist architecture designed by the legendary architect Antoni Gaudí.',
        fullDescription:
            '<p>The expiatory temple of the Sagrada Familia, the construction of which commenced in 1882, is today one of the emblems of Barcelona, known around the world and visited by millions of people. The part built by Gaudí was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005. The Construction Board hopes to finish the works in 2026, marking the centenary of Gaudí’s death.</p><p>In 1881, thanks to donations, the Spiritual Association of the Devotees of Saint Joseph bought a 12,800 m2 plot to build the temple. But the first stone was not placed until 19 March 1882, on Saint Joseph’s day. Initially, the project was commissioned to another architect, Francesc de Paula Villar, but Gaudí assumed the position at the end of 1883. His new project was much more ambitious than that proposed by his predecessor. It included the construction of a temple with 5 naves, a transept, an apse, an exterior ambulatory, 3 façades and 18 towers. It was the most complex and unique project that Gaudí had carried out throughout his professional career, to which he dedicated 43 years of his life.</p><p>The work of Antoni Gaudí, who wanted to create the perfect temple, presents the life of Jesus and the history of faith. The 18 towers are dedicated to important biblical figures, and this is reflected in their size: 12 of them represent the apostles, 4 the evangelists, one the Virgin Mary and the highest of them all represents Jesus Christ, which will be topped by a cross reaching a height of 172 metres. When it has been completed, the Sagrada Familia will be the highest building in Barcelona and the highest church in the world.</p>',
